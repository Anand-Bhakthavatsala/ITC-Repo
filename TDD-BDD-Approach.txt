TDD - Test Driven Development 
Test case development will start even before the coding 
1. Based on the requirement -> Develop/write the Test cases
2. Run all the TCs -> fail as there is NO code
3. Develop the code -> while TCs fail 
4. Again run/re-run the TCs and make the test case work as expected
5. Refactor the code -> Make it more reusable and readable
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for new Test cases 
-------------------------
BDD Requirements
1. Cucumber Eclispe Plugin from Eclipse Marketplace
2. Tidy Gherkins(TG) plugin to generate step definition
3. cucumber-java, cucumber-junit,cucumber-core -jar mvnrepository.com
--------
@Test -> TDD approach will fail as there is no implementation of the code
Public void checkLogin(){
   LoginPage.enterUserName("UserName");
   LoginPage.enterPassword("Password");
   HomePage homePage = LoginPage.submit();
   Assert.assertNotNull(homePage); //verification
}

BDD - Behavior Driven Development 
BDD is an extension to TDD

Process in BDD
1. Write the TCs based on the Behvaior of the application
2. Write the automated scripts
3. Implement the functional code
4. check if the behavior is successful or not
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat steps 1-5

Scenario:Login Check
Given I am on the login page
When I enter "username" username
And I enter "password" password
And click on the "Login" button
Then I am able to login sucessfully
